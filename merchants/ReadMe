Question:

Write a django app to store merchant’s details in database. Use sqlite3 as the database.

Merchant’s db schema:

name
description
logo_url
tagline
twitter_handle
phone
email
geo_location
address

Please put proper form validation as required. We need a working one page form which can take these 
values as input and store it in database. Another page is required to just list down all the 
merchants. Use appropriate data types for each field.
Thankyou!
